- 👋 Hi, I’m @Parextos
- 👀 I’m interested in programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning other code languages
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, depends...
- 📫 How to reach me, I will probably not answer you =/.
- 🤨 Why you checking my profile?
- 🧐 If something I said offended you I probably didn't do it on that purpose.
- 😁 Yeah I used the default read me.

Parextos/Parextos is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
Wow I am special 😁.
